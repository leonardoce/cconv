# iConv

This repo contains the sources for the "iConv" coordinate converter, which
is an Android application that was published on Android Play Store for
several years.

Now it's released as open source and available to everyone.

## Notes

The original application was published on the Play Store in two formats: one
ad-supported and one paid. This version is based on the paid application, with
full features.

The Google Maps integration has been removed to avoid issues with the Google
API usage policy. The Open Street Map integration is still available.

## How to install the application
